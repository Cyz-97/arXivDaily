        "abstract": "Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the dynamics and cosmological implications of dark energy (DE), modeled as a scalar field with a hyperbolic tangent potential that induces a smooth shift in the effective cosmological constant (CC), encompassing transitions such as AdS-dS, 0-dS, and dS-dS, with the mirror AdS-dS as a particular case aligned with the $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM scenario. In our construction, a phantom scalar field with a negative kinetic term drives a bottom-up transition from an AdS-like vacuum at high redshifts to a dS-like vacuum at low redshifts, thereby providing a physical underpinning for the $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM scenario. Despite the negative kinetic term, the step-like form of the potential prevents pathologies such as unbounded energy growth, Big Rip, and violations of the WEC. Our numerical integration of the equations of motion shows that the model is consistent with both CMB data and the SH0ES determination of $H_0$, thereby addressing the $H_0$ tension, with all key kinematical parameters-$H(z)$, $\\dot{H}(z)$, and $q(z)$-evolving smoothly. The total energy density of the phantom and matter system remains positive at all times, and the effective EoS stays above -1, ensuring that the WEC is satisfied. While the phantom field's energy density and pressure remain finite throughout, its EoS exhibits a safe singularity as its energy density smoothly crosses zero. We perform analysis of the transition period, demonstrating that the evolution of the DE density from a negative CC-like regime to a positive one does not exactly mirror the behavior of the potential-e.g., it lasts longer-as it also involves the kinetic term. We also show that analogous quintessence models featuring dS-dS transitions predict an $H_0$ value lower than $\\Lambda$CDM, thereby failing to address the $H_0$ tension. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for the $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM scenario.",

        "abstract": "In the presence of a light singlet-like scalar state, the Bino-dominated dark matter (DM) candidate in the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$-NMSSM exhibits significant differences from its counterpart in the MSSM, both in terms of intrinsic properties and mechanisms governing DM relic density and detection. Motivated by recent advancements in particle physics experiments, we systematically analyzed the implications of these developments for the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$-NMSSM framework featuring a light bino-dominated DM candidate and a light singlet-like scalar, ensuring theoretical consistency with empirical observations. Of paramount relevance are the latest direct detection constraints from the LZ experiment, SUSY searches at the LHC, and precision measurements of the Muon g-2 anomaly at Fermilab, which collectively impose complementary constraints on the model's parameter space. Our investigation utilized the MultiNest algorithm to perform a rigorous parameter space scan, informed by the LZ(2022) experimental limits, while incorporating constraints from LHC Higgs analyses, Muon g-2 data, and B-physics observables. The results demonstrate that current experimental bounds, particularly stringent limits on SI and SD DM-nucleus scattering cross-sections, coupled with LHC exclusion limits on electroweakinos, strongly disfavor this scenario. Nonetheless, the model retains the capacity to naturally reproduce the Z boson mass and Standard Model-like Higgs boson mass, explain the Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment, and generate substantial corrections to the W boson mass. These findings exclusively manifest within the NMSSM framework, arising from the interplay between bino-dominated DM and singlino components, mediated through indispensable higgsino participation.",

These resonances may manifest themselves when suitable unitarization techniques are implemented in the effective theory, which in the scalar-isoscalar channel require using the coupled-channel formalism. Experimental detection of a resonance would provide precious information on the couplings and constants of the relevant effective theory. Conversely, the absence of a resonance where the unitarized effective theory predicts it should be allows us to rule out a certaing range of couplings that would otherwise be allowed. Likewise, the appearence of unphysical (e.g. acausal) resonances is telling us that no UV completion could give rise to the corresponding couplings in the effective theory. In this talk we summarize the systematical procedure we have implemented in order to confront the effective theory with the absence or presence of resonances in the vector boson fusion channel at the LHC.",

        "title": "PREFACE: A search for long-lived particles at the Large Hadron Collider",
        "abstract": "The Standard Model (SM) fails to explain many problems (neutrino masses, dark matter, and matter-antimatter asymmetry, among others) that may be resolved with new particles beyond the Standard model (BSM). The fact that such new particles are not yet observed may be explained either by their too high mass or by very small coupling to SM particles. The latter case implies long lifetimes. Such long-lived particles (LLPs) would have signatures different from those of SM particles. Searches in the ``central region\" are covered by the LHC general purpose experiments. The forward small angle region far from the interaction point (IP) is unexplored. Such particles would have large energy $E$ = $\\mathcal{O}$(1~TeV) and Lorentz time dilation factor $\\gamma = E/m \\approx 10^2 - 10^{3}$, hence long decay distances. A new class of specialized LHC detectors dedicated to LLP searches has been proposed for the forward regions. Among these experiments, FASER is already operational, and FACET is under consideration at a location 100 meters from IP5 (the CMS intersection). However, some features of FACET require a specially enlarged beam pipe, which cannot be implemented for Run 4. In this study, we explore a simplified version of the proposed detector, PREFACE, compatible with the standard LHC beam pipe in the HL-LHC in Run 4. Realistic \\textsc{Geant4} simulations are performed and the background is evaluated. A preliminary analysis of the physics potential with the PREFACE geometry indicates that several significant channels could be accessible with sensitivities comparable to FACET and other LLP searches.",

        "abstract": "We investigate a novel freeze-in mechanism for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), facilitated by a supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the early universe. Unlike the conventional freeze-out and freeze-in scenarios, this mechanism allows WIMPs to acquire their relic abundance through a non-equilibrium production process following a rapid entropy injection. We explore multiple dark matter (DM) candidates, including vector, fermionic, and scalar-mediated models, and identify fermionic DM with a pseudoscalar mediator as the most viable candidate for this mechanism. The study demonstrates that FOPT dilutes preexisting DM density and simultaneously induces a rapid mass increase, preventing thermal re-equilibration and enabling DM production via freeze-in. Additionally, we analyze the gravitational wave (GW) signals associated with FOPT, identifying parameter regions detectable by future GW observatories such as LISA and UDECIGO. This framework offers a compelling alternative to traditional WIMP and Feebly Interacting Massive Particle (FIMP) scenarios, providing new avenues for DM model building and experimental verification.",

Parkhomov reported in the past the detection of strong, short, sporadic, nearly everyday decay rate increases in $\\beta$-isotopes placed at the focus of a concave mirror directed at a clear sky. He interpreted this effect as neutrino-induced decay. These neutrinos were assumed to be slow and arrive from space in the form of gravitationally collimated beams. We precisely replicated this experiment for the purpose of independent verification. We recorded about 50 days of data employing Geiger-counter-based signal and control detectors, $^{40}$K and $^{90}$Sr/$^{90}$Y isotopes as $\\beta$-sources. We did not detect any significant difference between the data from signal and control detectors, both datasets obeyed the standard Poissonian process. Thus, we robustly excluded the hypothesized new effect. We suspect that A. Parkhomov was just misled by a trivial electromagnetic instability of his setup.",

When one considers the Lagrangian in $d$-dimensional space-time instead of four dimensions in dimensional regularization, evanescent operators that break the chiral symmetry are induced. Consequently, $T$-odd and $P$-odd fermion loops in the BMHV scheme generates evanescent contributions to the QCD $\\theta$ angle. We carefully classify the evanescent contributions into two types: one originating from the evanescent operators at one-loop level and the other directly produced by two-loop calculations. We show that re-parameterizing the fundamental parameters can remove these unphysical contributions from the renormalization-group equation for the QCD $\\theta$ angle. We also discuss the rephasing invariance of the radiative correction to the QCD $\\theta$ angle in the BMHV scheme.",

These moments and their volume-independent products are sensitive to the correlation length, making them crucial observables in the search for the CEP. In this study, we investigate net-strangeness fluctuations using the finite-volume Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model, incorporating six-quark and eight-quark interactions at energy scales relevant to the RHIC beam energy scan. Our results are compared to STAR net-kaon data and the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model to assess the CEP's existence. Since direct measurement of conserved charges is experimentally challenging, net-proton, net-pion, and net-kaon are used as proxies for $\\Delta B$, $\\Delta Q$, and $\\Delta S$. We employ the Subensemble Acceptance Method (SAM) to analyze the acceptance dependence of $\\kappa\\sigma^{2}$ for net-strangeness fluctuations. Our findings establish a direct mapping between the subvolume (particle fraction) and the total volume (conserved quantities), providing insights into the role of experimental acceptance in fluctuation measurements.",

We resolve self-consistently the glue dynamics as well as the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking. The computation hosts no phenomenological parameter or external input. The only ultraviolet input parameters are the physical ones in QCD: the light and strange quark masses. They are adjusted to the physical ratios of the pion and kaon masses, divided by the pion decay constant. The results for other observables of current first-principles computations are in quantitative agreement with the physical ones. This work completes the series of papers, initiated and furthered in [1,2], on dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the emergence of mesonic bound states within the functional renormalisation group. As a first application we discuss the formation of light mesonic bound states. Amongst other applications such as the phase structure of QCD, the current work paves the way for studying QCD parton distribution functions within the functional renormalisation group approach to first-principles QCD.",

Our results are for combinations of $\\pi^+$ and $K^+$, at a lattice spacing $a=0.063\\;$fm, and in the isospin-symmetric limit. We also obtain accurate results for maximal-isospin two-meson amplitudes, with those for $\\pi^+ K^+$ and $2K^+$ being the first determinations at the physical point. Dense lattice spectra are obtained using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, and the analysis leading to scattering amplitudes is done using the relativistic finite-volume formalism.

Future neutrino experiments will improve the sensitivity to BNV nucleon decays and can serve to search for dark particles. In this work, we study the sterile neutrino effective field theories (EFTs) with baryon number violation and the impact of light sterile neutrino on BNV nucleon decays. We revisit the dimension-6 and dimension-7 EFT operator bases with $|\\Delta (B-L)|=2$ or $|\\Delta (B-L)|=0$. They are then matched to the baryon chiral perturbation theory. We obtain the effective chiral Lagrangian at low energies and the BNV interactions between the sterile neutrino and baryons and mesons. The rates of nucleon decay to SM neutrinos or a sterile neutrino are calculated. We then show the constraints on the ultraviolet scale from nucleon decay search at Super-K. The correlation of two EFT operators and the dependence on the sterile neutrino mass are also investigated.",

Identifying the signals induced by polarized vacuum relies on purifying the X-ray polarization and poses significant challenges due to strongly reduced signal and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here we propose an approach that allows one to directly detect VP signals without the need for an X-ray polarizer. We identify a new VP effect in collision of an X-ray probe with an intense laser in a vortex mode, which we call the super light-by-light scattering (super-LBL), through which signal photons are kicked out of the X-ray background with large tangential momentum. Super-LBL originates from the gradient force of the vortical vacuum current in azimuthal direction and induces momentum exchange beyond the transverse momentum of laser-photon. This effect efficiently sets the scattered signal photons apart from the X-ray background, producing observable signals with both the strength and SNR more than two orders of magnitude higher than those from the known VP effects. This finding paves the way for single-shot detection of nonlinear VP phenomena with current ultra-intense laser and XFEL technologies.",

From the real part of the self-energy, we find the dispersion relation and show that the $\\sigma$-mass receives a non-negligible thermal and baryon chemical dependent {contribution}.

Compared to light-cone-ordered perturbation theory in momentum space (LCOPT), the role of intermediate states in LCOPT is played in C-LCOPT by paths, which are ordered sequences of lines and vertices that connect pairs of external points. Each path denominator of C-LCOPT equals the difference between the separation of the minus coordinates of the beginning and ending points of the path and the sum of the light-cone minus momenta of all lines along the path computed from their plus and transverse coordinates. We observe that this formalism, originally applied to amplitudes, can be extended to cross sections, which are given in terms of closed paths reminiscent of Schwinger-Keldysh formalisms.",

        "title": "Analysis of symmetries in the Causal Loop-Tree Duality representations",
        "abstract": "Unveiling hidden symmetries within Feynman diagrams is crucial for achieving more efficient computations in high-energy physics. In this paper, we study the symmetries underlying the causal Loop-Tree Duality (LTD) representations through a geometric analysis. Focusing on the integrand-level representations of $N$-point functions at one loop, we examine their degenerations and discover that different causal representations are interconnected through specific transformations arising from the symmetries of cut diagrams. Furthermore, the degeneration is linked to algebraic constraints among the different causal thresholds. Our findings shed new light on the deeper structures of Feynman integrals and pave the way for significantly accelerating their calculation by interrelating different approaches.",

        "abstract": "Collisions of particles at the energy frontier can reveal new particles and forces via localized excesses. However, the initial observation may be consistent with a large variety of theoretical models, especially in sectors with new top quark partners, which feature a rich set of possible underlying interactions. We explore the power of the LHC dataset to distinguish between models of the singly produced heavy top-like quark which interacts with the Standard Model through an electromagnetic form factor. We study the heavy top decay to a top quark and a virtual photon which produces a pair of fermions, propose a technique to disentangle the models, and calculate the expected statistical significance to distinguish between various hypotheses.",
